> ABSTRACT: The goal of this paper is to investigate the use of representations of order in the context of classification. We present a novel representation, the order graph (OG), which is a directed graph that represents the order of the objects in a given set. We show that the OG can be used to learn a classifier, and that the learned classifier can be used to predict the order of objects in a set. We also show that the OG can be used to learn representations of order that are invariant to the order of the objects in the set. We demonstrate the use of the OG in the context of the classification of protein-protein interactions, and show that it is able to learn representations of order that are invariant to the order of the proteins in the set.

> ABSTRACT: Recently, there have been many approaches to sequence modeling. These approaches are classified into two types: one is based on the structure of the input sequence, and the other is based on the techniques used to train the model. In this paper, we review the approaches to sequence modeling based on the structure of the sequence. These approaches are divided into two types: one is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), and the other is based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). The former is the hidden state model, and the latter is the recurrent model. We review the approaches to sequence modeling based on the structure of the sequence.

> ABSTRACT: Deep neural networks have achieved great success in many pattern recognition tasks, including image classification and speech recognition. However, it is not clear how to design the deep neural network to achieve the best performance. In this paper, we propose a method to design the deep neural network. We propose a method to design the deep neural network with a bias term in the activation function. We show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of the deep neural network.

> ABSTRACT: This paper presents a set of techniques for extracting sequences of functions from Android applications. The techniques are based on the use of a set of heuristics that identify functions in Android applications and a set of machine learning classifiers that extract sequences of functions. The classifiers are trained with a set of labeled sequences of functions extracted from a set of Android applications. The classifiers are evaluated with a set of Android applications and the results show that they are able to extract sequences of functions with high precision and recall.

* keyword : wave, Markov, degradation, Vision, representation
> ABSTRACT: In this work, we present a novel approach for the analysis of the degradation of a wave front in a Markov chain. This approach is based on the use of a so-called Wavelet Markov chain that is defined as a Markov chain whose states are wavelet coefficients. In order to obtain this representation, we first decompose the wave field into wavelets using the Daubechies wavelet basis. Then, we use the wavelet coefficients to represent the wave field. We show that the Wavelet Markov chain associated with the wavelet coefficients of the wave field can be used to model the degradation of the wave front. We show that the Wavelet Markov chain associated with the wavelet coefficients of the wave field can be used to model the degradation of the wave front.

## keyword 6
* keyword : wave, GANs, work, codes, degradation
> ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present a novel approach for the degradation estimation of a signal based on the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The WPT is used to decompose a signal in a set of wavelet packets, which are then used as the input of the GANs. The GANs are trained to generate wavelet packets that match the original signal. The estimated degradation of the signal is obtained by comparing the original signal with the generated packets. The proposed approach is evaluated on synthetic and real data. The results show that the proposed approach is able to estimate the degradation of a signal with high accuracy.

* keyword : representations, approaches, point, expression, graph
> ABSTRACT: The representation of a point in a graph is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we propose a novel representation of a point in a graph based on the concept of point expression. We first define a point expression as a set of points that are connected to the point of interest by a path of a given length. We then introduce a new representation of a point in a graph, the point expression representation, which is based on the concept of point expression. We show that the proposed representation is a suitable representation of a point in a graph and can be used in many applications. We also show that the proposed representation is useful for dealing with the problem of point localization in graphs, which is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning.

## keyword 8
* keyword : applications, input, functions, sequence, techniques
> ABSTRACT: The proposed method can be used for predicting the next application to be launched by a user. Given the user’s history of applications launched, the next application to be launched is predicted by using the user’s input sequence and the sequence of applications launched. The proposed method is based on the assumption that the user’s input sequence is similar to the sequence of applications launched. The proposed method is implemented using the word2vec, a neural network model. The word2vec model is trained using the user’s input sequence and the sequence of applications launched. The trained word2vec model is used to predict the next application to be launched by the user. The proposed method was tested using the data collected from the Android smartphone. The experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the next application to be launched by the user with a high precision.

> ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting and counting the number of people in a scene. Our method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is trained to predict the number of people in a scene. The proposed method is able to detect the number of people in a scene even when occlusion occurs. We also propose a method for counting the number of people in a scene using a CNN. The proposed method is able to count the number of people in a scene even when occlusion occurs. Our method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and MIT-Harvard. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
